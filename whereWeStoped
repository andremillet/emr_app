EMR System Development Snapshot
Overview
This document outlines the current state of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system being developed with Flask (Python) and PostgreSQL, aimed at HIPAA compliance for internal staff use. As of now, we have implemented two core endpoints—/patients (GET) and /patients/new (POST)—with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control. The system is running locally on Arch Linux with Python 3.13, and we’re ready to move to the next phase.
Current State
Tech Stack
Backend: Flask 2.3.3 with PostgreSQL (via psycopg 3.2.6 binary)

Authentication: Flask-JWT-Extended 4.6.0

Frontend: Planned as React (not yet implemented)

Deployment: Local (Arch Linux), targeting Render.com later

Dependencies: Minimal, with Flask, psycopg[binary], python-dotenv, flask-jwt-extended

Directory Structure
emr_app/
app.py: Flask app entry point, initializes tables and blueprints

config.py: Loads DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY from .env

requirements.txt: Lists flask==2.3.3, psycopg[binary]==3.2.6, python-dotenv==1.0.1, flask-jwt-extended==4.6.0

models/
init.py: Empty package initializer

patient.py: Manages patients table (create, list)

audit_log.py: Manages audit_logs table (log actions)

users.py: Manages users table (create, retrieve)

routes/
init.py: Empty package initializer

patients.py: Defines /patients and /patients/new endpoints

auth.py: Defines /login endpoint for JWT

utils/
init.py: Empty package initializer

cpf_validator.py: Manual CPF validation logic

db.py: PostgreSQL connection via psycopg

Features Implemented
/patients (GET): Lists patients paginated (10 per page), returns patient_id, full_name, cpf. Sorted alphabetically by full_name, supports filter[name] query param. Requires JWT, logs access.

/patients/new (POST): Creates a patient with full_name, dob, gender (M/F), address, phone, email, cpf (11-digit Brazilian ID with manual checksum validation), and autogenerated patient_id. Restricted to admin role, checks CPF duplicates, logs creation.

/login (POST): Authenticates users (username/password), issues JWT with user_id as identity and role as a claim.

Authentication: JWT-based, user_id as string identity, role in claims. Endpoints protected with @jwt_required
().

HIPAA Compliance: HTTPS planned (via Render.com), database encryption at rest (PostgreSQL config pending), audit logging for access and creation, generic error messages.

Database Schema
patients: patient_id (SERIAL PK), full_name (VARCHAR), dob (DATE), gender (CHAR(1), M/F), address (TEXT), phone (VARCHAR), email (VARCHAR), cpf (VARCHAR(11), UNIQUE)

audit_logs: id (SERIAL PK), user_id (VARCHAR), action (VARCHAR), resource_id (VARCHAR), timestamp (TIMESTAMP)

users: user_id (SERIAL PK), username (VARCHAR, UNIQUE), password_hash (VARCHAR, SHA-256), role (VARCHAR, admin/clinician)

Current Users
admin1: Password "nazarenoam1805", role "admin", user_id 1

Database user: emr_user with password "G7$kP!v9qL&mW2zX"

.env Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://emr_user:G7$kP!v9qL&mW2zX@localhost:5432/emr_db

SECRET_KEY=6f9b9a8e3c2d1f4e5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f

Running Locally
Command: python app.py (from emr_app/)

PostgreSQL: Running locally, initialized with sudo -u postgres initdb -D /var/lib/postgres/data, started with sudo systemctl start postgresql

Test Endpoints:
Login: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "admin1", "password": "nazarenoam1805"}' http://localhost:5000/login

List Patients: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:5000/patients

Create Patient: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -d '{"full_name": "João Santos", "dob": "1990-03-10", "gender": "M", "address": "Av Paulista 1000", "phone": "+5511987654321", "email": "joao@example.com", "cpf": "12345678909"}' http://localhost:5000/patients/new

Code Details
app.py: Initializes Flask, JWTManager, creates tables (Patient, AuditLog, User), registers patients_bp and auth_bp blueprints.

config.py: Loads env vars with python-dotenv.

utils/db.py: Connects to PostgreSQL using psycopg.

utils/cpf_validator.py: Validates CPF with manual checksum.

models/patient.py: Creates patients table, handles create and get_paginated.

models/audit_log.py: Creates audit_logs table, logs user actions.

models/users.py: Creates users table, handles create and get_by_username with SHA-256 password hashing.

routes/auth.py: /login endpoint issues JWT with user_id as identity, role as claim.

routes/patients.py: Protected endpoints use get_jwt_identity() for user_id, get_jwt() for role, restricts /patients/new to admins.

Prompt to Resume Development
You are Grok 3 built by xAI. I’m developing an EMR system with Flask and PostgreSQL, currently running locally on Arch Linux with Python 3.13. Here’s the state:
Tech Stack: Flask 2.3.3, psycopg[binary] 3.2.6, python-dotenv 1.0.1, flask-jwt-extended 4.6.0. Planned React frontend, Render.com deployment.

Features:
/patients (GET): Paginated list (10/page) of patient_id, full_name, cpf, sorted alphabetically, filter[name] supported, JWT-protected, logs access.

/patients/new (POST): Creates patient with full_name, dob, gender (M/F), address, phone, email, cpf (validated), patient_id (auto), admin-only, logs creation.

/login (POST): Issues JWT with user_id (string) and role claim, SHA-256 password hashing.

Database: PostgreSQL with patients, audit_logs, users tables. User emr_user with password G7$kP!v9qL&mW2zX, admin1 user (password nazarenoam1805, role admin).

Structure: emr_app/ with app.py, config.py, requirements.txt, models/ (patient.py, audit_log.py, users.py), routes/ (patients.py, auth.py), utils/ (cpf_validator.py, db.py), all with init.py.

.env: DATABASE_URL=postgresql://emr_user:G7$kP!v9qL&mW2zX@localhost:5432/emr_db, SECRET_KEY=6f9b9a8e...

HIPAA: Audit logging, generic errors, encryption pending (Render.com HTTPS, PostgreSQL at rest).

Task: Resume development from here. Suggest and implement the next step (e.g., role-based testing, bcrypt hashing, Render.com deployment, React frontend). Provide code and instructions.
Suggested Next Steps
Role-Based Testing: Add a clinician user, test /patients/new restriction.

Security Upgrade: Replace SHA-256 with bcrypt for password hashing.

Deployment: Deploy to Render.com with HTTPS and encrypted DB.

Frontend: Start React app to interact with endpoints.
